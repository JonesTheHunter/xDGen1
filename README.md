# xDGen
This is a Console Application that will generated a list of random 12 digit numbers, depending on the amount of times set to generate by the user. There is an option to add a 6 digit prefix to the code as well.

For now it is intended to be used to generate random 12 digit numbers, however the plan is to allow the user to define the number generated.
