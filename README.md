# xDGen
This is a Console Application that will generate a list of random 12 digit numbers, depending on the amount of times set to generate by the user. There is an option to add a 6 digit prefix to the code as well.

**THIS VERSION IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED**
I have moved this same project to a UI Based application: https://github.com/daziki/xDGen2
